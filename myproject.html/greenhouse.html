    <h1> Greenhouse Effect</h1>
    <section>
        <h2> Introduction to Green house  </h2>
        <p class = intro>
            A greenhouse is a structure designed to create and maintain a controlled environment for the cultivation of plants.<br> It is primarily used for gardening and agricultural purposes, allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of plants, including vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants, in a controlled setting.<br> Greenhouses are built with transparent or translucent walls and roofs, typically made of materials like glass or plastic, to allow sunlight to enter while trapping heat.<br> This greenhouse effect, where sunlight is absorbed and re-radiated as heat within the structure, helps maintain a higher temperature and humidity level than the external environment.

            <h2> Advantages of green house</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Extended Growing Season: Greenhouses provide a stable and warmer environment, allowing plants to be grown year-round, even in regions with harsh winters.</li>
                 <li>Temperature Control: The temperature inside a greenhouse can be regulated to optimize plant growth, as different plants have specific temperature requirements.</li>       
            <li>Protection from Weather: Greenhouses shield plants from harsh weather conditions like strong winds, heavy rains, and hail, reducing the risk of damage.</li>
        <li>Pest and Disease Control: The controlled environment can help keep pests and diseases at bay, reducing the need for chemical treatments.</li>        
    <li> Increased Crop Yield: With optimal conditions, plants in greenhouses tend to grow faster and produce higher yields compared to open-field cultivation.</li>

        <h1> Effects of greenhouse </h1>
        <p>However, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has caused the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to a phenomenon known as global warming.
    
            The effects of global warming are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, melting glaciers and ice caps, and changes in ecosystems and wildlife populations.
            
            It is important that we take steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of global warming. This can be achieved through measures such as reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and protecting forests and other natural habitats.</p>
    
    <h1> Last Year data 2020</h1>
    <p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, the three greenhouse gases emitted by human activity that are the most significant contributors to climate change, continued their historically high rates of growth in the atmosphere during 2022. The global surface average for CO2 rose by 2.13 parts per million (ppm) to 417.06 ppm, roughly the same rate observed during the last decade. Atmospheric CO2 is now 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. Methane levels in the atmosphere are now more than two and a half times their pre-industrial level</p>

        <h1> Ways to reduce greenhouse</h1>
    <p style="color:aqua; background-color: black";> There are several ways to reduce greenhouse emission </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce energy consumption: You can reduce your energy consumption by turning off lights and electronics when they are not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and insulating your home to reduce heating and cooling needs</li>
    <li>Use renewable energy: You can switch to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydro power to reduce your reliance on fossil fuels</li>
    <li>Reduce waste: You can reduce waste by recycling, composting, and using reusable products instead of disposable ones 1</li>
<li> Reduce waste: You can reduce waste by recycling, composting, and using reusable products instead of disposable ones 1</li>
<li> Use public transportation: Using public transportation, carpooling, or biking instead of driving alone can significantly reduce your carbon footprint 1.</li>
<li>Support clean energy policies: You can support policies that promote clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon pricing or renewable energy mandates 3.

    I hope these suggestions help!</li>
